```{r}
shape <- 20
curve(dgamma(x, shape, shape/12), xlim = c(0, 30))

1/20
# can also be paramaterized with 

# if the inverse is this
rs <- rexp(30, 4)
# then the shape parameters are this
1/rs

# or 

# if the inverse is this
rs <- abs(rnorm(50, 0, 1))
# then the shape parameters are this
1/rs

curve(dgamma(x, shape, shape/12), xlim = c(0, 30))
for(s in rs){
  curve(dgamma(x, 1/s, 1/(s*12)), add = TRUE)
}
